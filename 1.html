<h2>Jin project란 무엇인가?</h2>
<a href=https://www.bing.com/search?q=%ec%9c%a0%ed%8a%9c%eb%b8%8c&qs=SC&pq=db&sc=8-2&cvid=F3991D39DD2046ABA42BF0334BB73BC0&FORM=QBRE&sp=1/"target="_blank" title="youtube specification">Jin project is going forward to respect the <strong>dream <u>diversity</u></strong></a>
<p>The first program that i made for this purpose
is jeaf program. The name of jeaf is coming
from four words. justice, eduaction, action
and freedom.</p> <p style="margin-top:40px;"><img src="Jin.jpg"width=50%>
  <p>Justice is about my philosophy that I want to make the people more happy by respecting their own dreams. Education means I adopt the education as a means for respecting others. Action means the people who have taken my program can have the strength to take actions. Freedom means by taking actions the people can get their freedom.</p>
